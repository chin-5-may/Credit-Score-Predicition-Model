# Credit-Score-Predicition-Model
Machine learning project for credit score prediction using financial features, data analysis, and Gradient Boosting model.
Credit Score Prediction with Machine Learning
This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on predicting credit scores using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to estimate an individual's credit score based on key financial features, helping lenders and institutions assess risk more accurately.

Project Overview
We use an enhanced credit dataset containing attributes such as payment history, annual income, debt-to-income ratio, and more. Through exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and visualization, the data is prepared for modeling.

The main model implemented is Gradient Boostingâ€”a robust ensemble learning algorithm chosen for its accuracy in regression tasks. The workflow includes training, testing, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics and visualizations like feature importance charts, correlation heatmaps, and actual vs. predicted score plots.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand feature distributions and relationships.

Feature Selection & Engineering: Identify influential predictors for credit scoring.

Model Development: Build and train a Gradient Boosting regression model.

Evaluation: Assess model accuracy with validation plots and metrics.

Reporting: Detailed documentation and interpretive insights.

Clone the repository.


Results
Our findings highlight annual income, payment history, and debt-to-income ratio as the most influential factors in credit score prediction, with models demonstrating strong accuracy and generalization.
